## What is Frappe?

Frappe, pronounced fra-pay, is a full stack, batteries-included, web framework written in Python and JavaScript with MariaDB as the database.
It is the framework which powers ERPNext. It is pretty generic and can be used to build database driven apps.

## Why frappe?

Frappe was built to power our flagship product ERPNext. The core philosophy at Frappe is write as less code as possible.
We prefer configuration over code. If a feature is generic and we need it, we put it right into the framework.
This has enabled us to build and maintain a complex application like an ERP which has thousands of features with a small team of developers.

SMEs face similar complexities but have limited resources to deal with them.
