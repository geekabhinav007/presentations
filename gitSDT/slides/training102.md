## What is Data Structures?
A data structure is a method of organizing data in a virtual system.


<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
## Why we need Data Structures?

Any Fool can write a code that computer can Understand. Good Programmer write code that human can understand.

## Algorithms!!!
An algorithm is a sequence of steps executed by a computer that takes an input and transforms it into a target output. 


<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
## Array
An array is a collection of items of same data type stored at contiguous memory locations.

## Strings
Strings are defined as an array of characters. The difference between a character array and a string is the string is terminated with a special character ‘\0’.

## Linked List
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.

- Circular
- Doubly

## Stack
A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle. Stack has one end, whereas the Queue has two ends (front and rear). It contains only one pointer top pointer pointing to the topmost element of the stack. Whenever an element is added in the stack, it is added on the top of the stack, and the element can be deleted only from the stack. In other words, a stack can be defined as a container in which insertion and deletion can be done from the one end known as the top of the stack.

## Queue
A Queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.

## Tree
A tree data structure is a non-linear data structure because it does not store in a sequential manner.

## Graphs

A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

## Greedy Algorithms

Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. So the problems where choosing locally optimal also leads to global solution are the best fit for Greedy.

- Activity Selection Problem
- Fractional Knapsack Problem
- Job Sequencing Problem

## Recursion and Backtracking

Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point in time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree).  Backtracking can also be said as an improvement to the brute force approach. So basically, the idea behind the backtracking technique is that it searches for a solution to a problem among all the available options.

## Projects
- Metro Program
- Basic Notepad

[Github Repo Link for Both project](https://github.com/geekabhinav007/training102-project-)

## Metro Program

![metro](https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/32d357b3399ae2ea0f72893a14d772677ecc04c4/1-Figure1-1.png)


This is a simple Java program that will take information (name) of the source station and
the destination station, of Delhi Metro, from the user and display the fare and shortest
metro route to reach the destination. It will also be having a metro map for commuter’s
better navigation.

## Basic Notepad
This is a simple text editing application in Python, which supports the basic text operations
like Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo, and also basic file operations like New, Save, and Open.
It has some great features like Unlimited Undo and Redo Operations, Night-mode. This
was developed for exploring the Python GUI and to enhance my DSA skills.
